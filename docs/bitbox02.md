# BitBox02

The BitBox02 is supported by HWI

Current implemented commands are:

- `displayaddress`
- `togglepassphrase` (TODO)
- `getmasterxpub`  (TODO)
- `signtx`  (TODO)
- `getxpub`  (TODO) (with some caveats)

## Usage Notes


## `getxpub` Caveats

The BitBox02 requires that one of the levels in the derivation path is hardened.

## Note on `setup` & `restore`

The BitBox02 needs to be set up and restored via the BitBoxApp.
